Programmatically generate LookML


* Free software: Apache Software License 2.0
* Documentation: https://lookml-gen.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Generate LookML views programmatically
* Include dimensions, dimension groups, filters, and measures
* Write output to files or StringIO buffers


TODOs
-----

Full LookML support is far from complete right now. At the moment only very basic
aspects of Views and Fields are supported and there is no support for Explores yet.
However, the code can easily be extended and we'd love to get pull requests to fill
out functionality.
